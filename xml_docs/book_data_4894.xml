  <description>Jack Welch knows how to win. During his forty-year career at General Electric, he led the company to year-after-year success around the globe, in multiple markets, against brutal competition. His honest, be-the-best style of management became the gold standard in business, with his relentless focus on people, teamwork, and profits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since Welch retired in 2001 as chairman and chief executive officer of GE, he has traveled the world, speaking to more than 250,000 people and answering their questions on dozens of wide-ranging topics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by his audiences and their hunger for straightforward guidance, Welch has written both a philosophical and pragmatic book, which is destined to become the bible of business for generations to come. It clearly lays out the answers to the most difficult questions people face both on and off the job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welch's objective is to speak to people at every level of an organization, in companies large and small. His audience is everyone from line workers to MBAs, from project managers to senior executives. His goal is to help everyone who has a passion for success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welch begins &lt;em&gt;Winning&lt;/em&gt; with an introductory section called "Underneath It All," which describes his business philosophy. He explores the importance of values, candor, differentiation, and voice and dignity for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The core of &lt;em&gt;Winning&lt;/em&gt; is devoted to the real "stuff" of work. This main part of the book is split into three sections. The first looks inside the company, from leadership to picking winners to making change happen. The second section looks outside, at the competition, with chapters on strategy, mergers, and Six Sigma, to name just three. The next section of the book is about managing your careerâ€”from finding the right job to achieving work-life balance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welch's optimistic, no excuses, get-it-done mind-set is riveting. Packed with personal anecdotes and written in Jack's distinctive no b.s. voice, &lt;em&gt;Winning&lt;/em&gt; offers deep insights, original thinking, and solutions to nuts-and-bolts problems that will change the way people think about work.</description>

  <description>In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.</description>

  <description>In his landmark bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/em&gt;, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt;, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt; is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt; we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt; reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction: The statue that didnÂ´t look right&lt;br&gt;1. The Theory of Thin Slices: How a little bit of knowledge goes a long way&lt;br&gt;2. The Locked Door: The secret life of snap decisions&lt;br&gt;3. The Warren Harding Error: Why we fall for tall, dark, and handome men&lt;br&gt;4. Paul Van RiperÂ´s Big Victory: Creating structure for spontaneity&lt;br&gt;5. KennaÂ´s Dilemma: The right -and wrong- way to ask people what they want&lt;br&gt;6. Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The delicate art of mind reading&lt;br&gt;Conclusion: Listening with your eyes -the lessons of &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Afterword&lt;br&gt;Notes&lt;br&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;br&gt;Index&lt;br&gt;Reading Group Guide&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.</description>

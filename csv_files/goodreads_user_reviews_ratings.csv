      This book is evocative and imaginative and I stayed up till 3 to finish it (yawn). But it's also lacking in any real character nuance or complexity - it's a good witches versus bad demons kind of affair. But I accepted its limitations and let it transport me into a far away place were spirits are...

      Yes, it's a total book club/beach book that I actually did finish at the beach today. But it's just really really hard to put down! The formula is simplistic and characters are pretty much good or evil, but it's also really suspenseful and absorbing. I'm sad I finished it so fast!<br />

      Absolutely amazing memoir of his life as a young blind boy learning his way in India. I want to read more by Ved Mehta.

      Absorbing in that totally soap opera way, reminds me of Box Office Poison. The drawings really capture the characters and emotional twists of a single man's melodrama.

      This book reads like many best sellers in that the characters speak and act in completely unrealistic ways. Overly dramatic. Descriptions that sound like dating profiles. Charicatures. And yet... charicatures can make page-turning characters. The action ain't subtle but it's absorbing. So, yeah,...

      Going into this book, you definitely to have the realization that there is no one-size-fits-all. However, I don't think that Dr. Leman seems to think that there is any other way but his way. He does not really take any form of disablilities, etc., into consideration. I think that there are many i...

      Interesting perspectives and makes sense the way he presents them, however these are only a small measurement of why you are the way you are.

      I love historical reads. It's fun to read what life may have been like during specific historical events. This story was a little of the slow side for me, but in the end it was a worthwhile read.

      I love the simplicity and practicality of this so-called slacker mom. I don't agree with all of her points of view, but it's nice to know that I'm not the only one who doesn't think that everything has to come with bells and whistles to be acceptable.

      Trying to get to the end of this one. The town has its own sort of Loch Ness Monster that turns up. There is some humor to going back home and seeing how some folks turned out, or rather, just never left. But the main character is somewhat interesting since she is a complete mess. I am interested...

      It was a decent compilation of different places and the stories behind them. Not really captivating though. If anything, maybe it's a good guide to checking out some of the locations.

      This book had me hooked. It started off with the narrator describing his fiery car crash, accompanied by each painful sensation in vivid detail. I literally winced at each.

      This series seems to be going more into urban fantasy than romance. not sure I'll keep up with it if the trend continues.

      So far, pretty interesting. Little sprinkles of history added here and there to keep me reading. The take on vampires is a little bit different too. Always a good thing to find.

      Loved it! Couldn't put it down. I have to add to this. It's been haunting me all week, I'm considering reading it again this week before I take it back to the library. Can't wait for the continuance.

      <strong>Soulful beginning to 2016</strong><br /><br />I would highly recommended to anyone who need an inspirational read. The emotions that Cheryl was experiencing while on her journey made the reader just as emotional. A great read!

      As with most of her books, it's a fun, easy read. But a guilty pleasure...some foul language and random comments about sex.

      Not one of David Mitchell's best. It's another complicated plot structure, but I don't think he pulls it off as well this time. Still a good read that had be turning the pages.
  "
180846,10335308,3,"
      Some pretty funny moments and generally light reading.
  "
180846,9231999,4,"

180846,6314763,4,"
      I liked it. She's reflective, likeable and observant of prison life.
  "
180846,3245249,4,"
      Not a great book, but a good one, and a good way to learn about education reform and efforts to fight urban poverty.
  "
180846,3366896,4,"
      I liked it. It's the best Ghanaian novel I've read.
  "
180846,28940,4,"
      The writer is crazy smart and this is a funny, tragic and engaging read.
  "
180846,94053,5,"
      I love this book. I particularly enjoyed reading it in this stage of life, because I saw a lot of parallels with living in Ghana.
  "
180846,3805,3,"
      Very well-written, but extremely depressing. There are no admirable characters in this one.

180846,13454654,3,"
      I learned a lot of about 19th century Afghanistan. Dalyrmple is an engaging writer, as usual. 
  "

      Fun, but not as good as the original.
  "
180846,17333230,4,"

  "
180846,15811505,3,"
  "
180846,3591262,2,"
      Good in parts, but a bit melodramatic for my taste.
  "
180846,414084,3,"
      I enjoyed this. It's too broad a topic to cover super well, and I wish Starr would tell more specific stories, but I still enjoyed it and felt like a learned a lot about my home state.
  "
180846,6570502,4,"
      I found this thought-provoking and useful.
  "
180846,2052,3,"
      My first Raymond Chandler book. I liked it. The best part was probably reading about LA in a different era.
  "
180846,2936415,3,"
      The author tries to make more of this story than is really there I think, but I did appreciate the window into the NFL and the military. 
  "
180846,4285768,3,"
      Not one of the best in the series, but still quite delightful in moments.

      Wow, this is quite a book. It gets inside the lives and thoughts of slumdwellers in India and I learned a ton just through their stories. I was really impressed.
  "
180846,13641208,0,"
  "
180846,13507212,4,"
      not as good as the first, but still brilliant. I'm looking forward to part 3.
  "
180846,13372977,3,"
      Not that well-written, but still glad I read it, since I learned a lot. The author does a good job of presenting a balanced assessment.
  "
180846,6101138,4,"
  "
180846,6819,3,"
      not Mitchell's best, but still a good read.

      This book is a good introduction to randomized control trials and a lot of the research that has been done on poor communities using this methodology. I liked its conclusion, about how we can make a difference at the margin with evidence-based interventions.

      I almost didn't make it through this one. By the time I got halfway through, the story was so depressing that I found myself picking up almost ANYTHING else to read. But I hung in there, and it was definitely worth it.

      This is one of those books that's such a classic that you keep thinking you've already read it.

Only halfway through the Iliad now, but blood-soaked legendary tragedies are perfect early spri...
  "
351186,10775,5,"
      This may be the perfect book to read at a beach, any beach. Well, ok, not any beach. I mean, you can't read this on a rocky coastline with salt spray misting your brow. It has to be sandy, secluded, and preferably quite warm and sunny. Yes, it is really perfect for that kind of beach.
  "

      I read this on a long flight and was quite entertained. I always buy Philip Roth in airport bookstores. Maybe it's because he writes best-sellers I can actually stand to read.

351186,120540,3,"
      i think i would have liked it more if he were so typically, surrealistically, boringly self-centered. because otherwise it's so beautiful.
  "
351186,46430,5,"
      perfection in character development. oh so dry and clever. not witty. clever.
  "
351186,46429,5,"
      I read this over and over. I started it again on the train this morning. So classic. I always forget the little twists and turns and so I'm thrilled anew each time.
  "
351186,15197,5,"
      I think I read this masochistically the following year simply in order to deepen my newfound sense of German guilt.
  "
351186,15196,5,"
      My dad gave this to me when it came out. I was nine. <br />""Here, sweetie, I brought you a comic book."" <br />""Thanks, daddy! What is it?"" <br />""It's a history of the Holocaust, where the German people collaborated in the mass murder of millions of Jews. Know your history."" <br />And I was never the same.

      i had only ever read her poetry up until now and i like her poetry better. mainly because this is hard to read as far as theory goes - it feels a little rambling in its separate parts. oh, but the upside of that is that she manages to write together lots of different types of feminisms, socialism...

351186,21996,2,"
      don't bother. the history of chicago stuff was interesting but nothing you couldn't learn by watching the history channel. the serial killer subplot is just kinda lame. i mean i realize it's true and all, but...boring.
  "
351186,25354,5,"
      i cannot believe it took me so long to get around to reading this. when i finally opened it, i read it compulsively twice over and then felt exhausted. this is now on my mandatory must-read list of recommendations, although probably everyone else has already read it.
  "
351186,109723,5,"
      oh, how i heart edmund white. read all his other books first, is my advice.
  "
351186,879162,3,"
      ok, who uses monotype times in a 1994 reprint edition? i mean, seriously, were they trying to make this even harder to read?

351186,91437,4,"
      i would never have noticed that she actually uses faulkner's technique of narrating through multiple first-person voices if i hadn't read these together completely at random. made me wonderfully homesick for the north.
  "
351186,77013,4,"
      can't say much about this that hasn't been said. i do think it's pretty hilarious that the editors thought it needed a glossary to handle all those quaint colloquialisms. it really doesn't.
  "
351186,953994,5,"
      i really don't generally appreciate travel books about places i have no intention of visiting. but this is not a travel book, not really. it's just an amazing book. breathtaking portraiture of an ancient beauty.
  "
351186,45791,5,"

      this is not a work of art at all. words like 'crass,' 'vulgar,' and 'misogynistic' spring to mind. race relations analysis is entirely missing. which wouldn't necessarily be a problem but for the fact the the book actually purports to examine sexual/racial conflict! remarkably shallow. also, i ha...
  "
351186,126609,5,"
      i really can't explain why i liked this book so much! not particularly flattering to women in general and overly concerned with materiality. i was absolutely engrossed. must be what's known as good writing.
  "
351186,1770386,3,"
      a retelling of the leo frank story from his own (fictional) perspective. started out loving it; got bored. sucks to be the mtv generation, i guess.
  "
351186,95127,4,"
      have i mentioned i heart memoirs? this one's classic in all the right ways. but i notice all the blurbs mention how ""unique,"" ""individual,"" and ""personal"" it is...those must be the words we use to talk about narratives we can't fit into that stupid american dream story we like to tell ourselves.

As always in Allende's novels, there is a wonderf...

      I enjoyed this book though it was bit dated. It's the story of a retired judge who must make some very difficult moral decisions to protect his ward and her husband.

      I am somewhat ambivalent about this book. On the one hand, Allende spent a great deal of time developing the characters which is what she does best.

      I am torn with the star rating--the book is really around a 3.5, but that's not an option. For the most part I enjoyed this book, but it has some flaws as well.

      I really enjoyed this book. According to Starr, at the heart of all three Abrahamic religions are teachings about love for God, other humans and the entire creation. She skillfully shows many of these parallels under different themes such as prayer, service, etc. mostly using the sacred literatur...

      I loved this book. My book group has read several books on meditation and mindfulness and all of us agree that we need to practice this, and we all agree that finding time is a challenge in busy lives. What is great about this book is it's practicality, especially in the beginning of the book. Nh...

      This was a thoroughly likable book with some good insights. Miller takes ordinary tasks, such as laundry, cooking and gardening to show the reader how to approach them in the Buddhist way of being fully present to the task at hand. I enjoyed it and am considering ideas as I am beginning meditatio...

      Book group choice. Very good overview of the life of Muhammed. He was a lot different than I have been led to believe--much more interested in good relationships with other religion, the equality of women, the need for people to live in community with one another and his own understanding of hims...

      Excellent book. This is a collection of Bishop Tutu's speeches and articles in which he addresses the human condition at large and the condition of the South African people in particular both during and after Apartheid. He states frequently that he feels that people of faith need to be on the sid...

      This is an interesting book with some good ideas. There are some things that Rubin does to fulfill her goals that are either over the top or a good bit off the mark, but she consistently reminds readers that we don't have to do things the way she did them. Her ideas about shaping one's attitude a...

      Finished this this week in time for book group last night. I have to agree with my friend Erica--I wanted to love it and parts of it I did love. Basically, this is Sara Miles story of how she became a Christian in a local San Francisco Episcopal church and she started a food pantry that fed 200-3...

      Absolutely LOVED this book. <br /><br />I will defintely read this book again. There is so much wisdom in many of these essays. While there are some essays that are a bit philosophical and need a bit more concentration, most of them are very practical in their approach to handling difficult/stressful/heartbr...

      Finished this with book group last night. Great discussion surronding Victor Frankenstein's selfishness and how it finally destroyed everyone he loved and him. I have always been fascinated by one of the themes of the book--the relationship of the Creator to the Created--and how it creates the qu...

      Overall, this book was interesting. Gordon basically takes the Abraham/Sarah/Hagar story from Genesis and expands on it, offering explanations of what was happening historically and what relationship these three people may have had. Gordon poses the question as to why the people of the three reli...

      This book is excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Elizabeth Gilbert is off again to explore the world, but not because she needs to find out who she is this time. The Department of Homeland Security has informed her and her lover Felipe (the man she met at the end of Eat,Pray,Love) that they mu...

      This book was wonderful. I loved much of the Buddhist approach to life and the planet and the world that the Dalai Lama teaches. The book is set up in an interview format, and he talks about the Buddhist beliefs as well as his own personal opinion about everything from relationships to relations...

      Finally finished this one for the book group. Basically it is a history of the development of Christian morality in the first four centuries of the Christian Church which is still being taught in many churches today. Apparently, we have Augustine to thank for many of the beliefs about sexuality a...

      Finished the book finally. This book is about an Episcopal Priest who, after twenty years in parish ministry, decides to leave the church. The book has some interesting points and I I liked some of them, especially her conclusions about organized religion and what Jesus' purpose was. But I found...

      This is a collection of short essays based on the NPR show of the same name. In the introduction, they explain that the show was started in the 1950's and some of the essays included are from that original broadcast. The essays basically complete the statement, ""This I believe..."" Some are religi...

      I have a several thoughts about this book. Overall I liked it very much and found it to be fairly true to life in how families work with one another. At times, however, I found it tedious--as if I was really in the room with the family as they bickered and aired petty grievances with one another....

      It took me a while to finish this book, though I realy enjoyed it. I am glad that I traveled out to Arizona before reading this book because the landscape is very important to this story, though Arizona is not the setting, and it helped me to picture the descriptions better.<br /><br />The main character is...

      I really enjoyed this book, which is easily read in one sitting. It's about an old Cuban fisherman who catches the fish of a lifetime. Unfortunately, he is alone in the open sea and must cope with the ocean and its' rules and wildlife. I found the old man, Santiago, fascinating as he thinks about...

      Finished this in the car this morning. This book was beautifully written, actually poetic in some places, and well narrated. It's often hard to listen to because I knew the ending, which of course was a lot of death and destruction but not the end of the war. However, Shaara does a wonderful job...

      I really liked this book. It's a story about a New England family who has become more wealthy through the centuries, but ""dessicated"" as people, so that they keep carrying on, but life moves more like a protected dream than real life. It's a bit of a cliche--the wealthy people in the big house ha...

      Very well written. Wilder tries to tackle the great unanswerable question as to why we suffer and die unexpectedly--is it because we are so good that we should be in heaven or is it because we are so bad we shouldn't be here to keep making the world worse. What Wilder manages to do, and do beauti...

      WOW! This book is outstanding. If I could give it more stars, I would. I actually had to stop myself from reading it until two or three in the morning on work nights because I wanted to know what was going to happen with these characters. <br /><br />For me, what made this book so amazing was Diaz's ability...

      I enjoyed this book in pieces, it seemed. There were sections of dialogue and character description that were funny and often brilliant. Then there were sections that seemed to go on forever. The book just didn't pull me in, though I suspect that that has more to do with me not making the connect...

644356,542883,4,"
      I really enjoyed this book. I felt that the characters were sympathetic and the story, surprisingly, fairly simple and straightforward. The story relies on a couple of coincidences to create the story--for instance, when Wully and Chirstie meet and at the climax of the book, but they are blended...

      It's hard to describe what I thought of this book. On the one hand, I thought it was very well written and I really liked/empathized with Claude Wheeler, the main character, which is why I gave it four stars. On the other hand, I thought it was very slow moving and the end seemed a bit abrupt. I...

      Just finished this book in the wee hours of this morning and I really enjoyed it. It turns out that the book starts around 1914, just before Europe becomes engaged in WWI. It ends a couple of years later, as far as I could tell, just before the U.S. enters the war. Roger Gale is the main characte...

      I really enjoyed this book, though the characters seemed a bit on the melancholy side. Olive is a great character and I think the author did a good job of showing her multi-faceted personality, though she was fairly curmudgeonly overall. I was very much surprised by the ending. I'm not sure what...

      "      I really liked this book. It's a story about a New England family who has become more wealthy through the centuries, but \"dessicated\" as people, so that they keep carrying on, but life moves more like a protected dream than real life.

      "      Very well written. Wilder tries to tackle the great unanswerable question as to why we suffer and die unexpectedly--is it because we are so good that we should be in heaven or is it because we are so bad we shouldn't be here to keep making the world worse.
